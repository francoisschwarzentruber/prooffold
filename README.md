## Raison d'Ãªtre

It tries to solve two main issues of traditional proofs written in a book:
- the global organization of a proof in a textbook is often not very clear. This is due to the linearity of a textual proof. Here, the proof is displayed in panels, making an emphasis on the structure of the proof
- In a textbook, justifications of a statement often ends up "by Theorem 1.2.3, Lemma 42.4 and Corollary 8.8.4 and Equation 1". Here, by clicking on a statement, the arguments used to deduced that fact are highlighted.







# Features

 - [X] Structured proofs

# Documentation

## Overview

Proofs are easy to be written. 

      Fact
      Theorem. $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$.
            {
              explain sth of the proof of the theorem
              an amazing fact       (1)
              {
                 proof of that amazing fact
              }
              we have that $x = 0$         (2)
              Thus we have bling       by (1,2)
            }
      Another Fact
      
      
Each line is a fact, or simple text. Blocks (panels) are delimited by `{` and `}` and corresponds to a detailed proof of the fact written just before the block. `     (1)`, `   (2)` etc. and `      by (1,2)` enable to highlight some facts used to prove another fact. In the example below, `Thus we have bling` is deduced from `an amazing fact` and `we have that $x = 0$`.




Graphs in graphviz are described by:

             graph {
                 <<graphviz code>>
              }

             digraph {
                 <<graphviz code>>
              }
                   

Algorithms need indentation and they can be written via:

             algo {
                 <<description of the algorithm>>
              }
              
Interactive canvas are described in Processing (P5) via:

             p5 {{
                 <<graphviz code>>
              }}
              



# How to contribute?

Adding new proofs! Also discussing about how to improve the way to display proofs.

1) Create a new file in the `proofs` folder, for instance `myproof.proof`.
2) Write your proof inside
3) Locally run `./run.sh`
4) Open http://0.0.0.0:8000/?id=myproof

Then if you want, you can make a **pull request**!
